# Calculator

## Description

This is a simple calculator web application which includes all the basic math operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project lets you perform these operations by creating variables for the first number, operator, and the second number, which are then displayed. It also has a clear button to start a new calculation.

## Bug Precautions

- Make sure to input all parts of the operation before pressing the equals key (=).
- Do not divide by zero. It will display a snarky error message and will not cause the calculator to crash.
- If your calculation yields a result with a long decimal, it will be rounded off to fit the screen.
